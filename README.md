### Welcome

It is fun to build solutions for Amazon Web Services (AWS) that improve threat detection and reduce response times necessary for incident mitigation. In today's escalating Cybersecurity climate, there should not be a barrier to entry for having security capabilities in your environments. I help by contributing to open-source solutions written using Cloud Development Kit (CDK) in Python. Providing the ability for anyone to tell the story of what happened, as we all need the same data to be successful, just applied differently for troubleshooting and security.
